# Number Guesser
---
**Project description**: 
We built a game where a 2 users can guess a number between 1-100, with the ability for a custom range to be inputted for increased difficulty of play, it display the current guess of both players, it displays the final results of each match in card UI, each card displays the name of the winner, each card displays both player’s names, each card shows how many guesses it took to guess the correct number. Two inputs to set a custom range for the random number to fall within, a button updates the custom range for each player: an input field for guessing the number which can only accept numeric values, an input field for their name that can accept any alpha-numeric character, one button that submits both players guesses, a button for clearing the input field which does not reset the random number, one button that resets the game and generates a new random number, and the clear button is disabled if there is nothing to clear. The reset button is disabled if there is nothing to reset. Our game displays both player’s most recent guesses, displays results and feedback for each player’s guess: If their guess is too high, it displays the error message: “That’s too high”, If their guess is too low, it displays the error message: “That’s too low”, If the guess is correct, it displays the success message: “BOOM!” and create a new card to display results. Finally, both player’s names are displayed, winning players are indicated, total combined guess count of both players is displayed, and the delete button removes the card from page. Finally, each card has a delete button that removes the card from the page.
